sc-hacks is a library for SuperCollider which supports live-coding and application design.

Use is made of the sample bank and buffer loading code of SuperDirt from the [[https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal][tidalcycles]] repository by [[http://slab.org][Alex McLean]]. 

This library reviews the techniques developed previous libraries for SuperCollider [[https://github.com/iani/tiny-sc][tiny-sc]] and [[https://github.com/iani/tiny-inc][tiny-inc]], and builds a cleaner, more consistent version.

Documentation on the new library is available here: http://iani.github.io/sc-hacks-doc/.
