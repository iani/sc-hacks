This library reviews the techniques developed previous libraries for SuperCollider [[https://github.com/iani/tiny-sc][tiny-sc]] and [[https://github.com/iani/tiny-inc][tiny-inc]], and builds a cleaner, more consistent version.

Documentation on the new library is available here: http://iani.github.io/sc-hacks-doc/.
