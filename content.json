To create this behavior instead, add a method to Symbol for accessing the kind of object needed. For example: \\aSymbol.oscFunc. This also allows easier customization of how the object is created if not found. Example This is the code that makes it possible to create or modify an OSCFunc bound to a symbol. It defines the methods Function:oscFunc and Symbol:removeOsc. + Function {&#10;&#9;oscFunc { | path |&#10;&#9;&#9;path.removeOsc;&#10;&#9;&#9;^Registry (&#39;oscFuncs&#39;, path, { OSCFunc (this, path) });&#10;&#9;}&#10;}&#10;&#10;+ Symbol {&#10;&#9;removeOsc {&#10;&#9;&#9;Registry.doIfFound (&#39;oscFuncs&#39;, this, { | found |&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;found.objectClosed;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;found.free;&#10;&#9;&#9;}); &#10;&#9;}&#10;} How it works Store an object in Library under an array of objects (called a path). When accessing the path, create the object if not already stored, else return the previously stored object.
