How it works An EventPattern creates EventStreams which are played by EventStreamPlayer. EventStream stores an event whose values are streams and uses this to produce a new event which is played by EventStreamPlayer. It is thus possible to modify the event stored in the EventStream while the EventStreamPlayer is playing it. This makes it easy to modify a playing pattern (which is difficult when using Pbind). Example () +&gt; \\e; 0.1 +&gt;.dur \\e; Pseq ((0..20), inf) +&gt;.degree \\e; Prand ((0..20), inf) +&gt;.degree \\e; (freq: Pfunc ({ 300 rrand: 1000 }), dur: Prand ([0.1, 0.2], inf)) +&gt; \\e; (freq: Pfunc ({ 30.rrand(80).midicps }), dur: Pfunc ({ 0.1 exprand: 1 }), legato: Prand ([0.1, 2], inf)) +&gt; \\e; (degree: Pseq ((0..20), inf), dur: 0.1) +!&gt;.degree \\e; Note: +&gt; adds all key-value pairs of an event to the event being played. +!&gt; replaces the contents of the event being played by the contents of the new event.","categories":[{"name":"classes","slug":"classes","permalink":"http://iani.github.io/categories/classes/"}],"tags":[{"name":"EventStream","slug":"EventStream","permalink":"http://iani.github.io/tags/EventStream/"},{"name":"EventPattern","slug":"EventPattern","permalink":"http://iani.github.io/tags/EventPattern/"},{"name":"EventStreamPlayer","slug":"EventStreamPlayer","permalink":"http://iani.github.io/tags/EventStreamPlayer/"}]},{"title":"Notification: Register a function callback to a message and a pair of objects","slug":"Notification","date":"2017-06-05T15:42:21.000Z","updated":"2017-06-06T07:41:10.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/06/05/Notification/","link":"","permalink":"http://iani.github.io/2017/06/05/Notification/","excerpt":"Notification is an improved version of the NotificationCenter class. This class enables objects to register a function which is called when another object changes according to some aspect. The aspect is expressed by a symbol. To trigger a notification action, one sends the message changed to an object together with a symbol expressing the aspect which changed. The function will only be evaluated for those objects which have registered to listen to the changing object according to the given aspect symbol. This allows detailed control of callback execution amongst objects of the system. For example, one can tell a gui object to change its color to green when a synth starts, and to change its color to red when that synth stops.","text":"Notification is an improved version of the NotificationCenter class.

This allows detailed control of callback execution amongst objects of the system. For example, one can tell a gui object to change its color to green when a synth starts, and to change its color to red when that synth stops. Notification adds the following enhancements: Ability to remove existing notification connections reliably. Several methods for easily adding or modifying connections between objects. Ability to remove all connections from an object with a single message, objectClosed, and also to execute additional actions when that object closes. Closing here means that the object is freed and will no longer be used by the system. Examples onObjectClosed Registry uses onObjectClosed to remove objects by sending them that message: *new { | ... pathAndFunc |&#10;&#9; var path, makeFunc, instance;&#10;&#9; makeFunc = pathAndFunc.last;&#10;&#9; path = pathAndFunc[0..pathAndFunc.size-2];&#10;&#9; instance = Library.global.atPath(path);&#10;&#9; if (instance.isNil) {&#10;&#9;&#9; instance = makeFunc.value;&#10;&#9;&#9; Library.global.putAtPath(path, instance);&#10;&#9;&#9; instance.onObjectClosed(this, {&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9; this.remove(*path)&#10;&#9;&#9; });&#10;&#9; };&#10;&#9; ^instance;&#10;} This is in turn used by oscFunc and rout methods for removing OSCFunc and Routine objects in order to replace them with new instances. addNotifierOneShot The addNotifierOneShot method executes the registered Function just once. This is useful when it is clear that only one call is required. For example, the onEnd and onStart methods for Node make use of the addNotifierOneShot method: + Node {&#10;&#9;onStart { | listener, action |&#10;&#9;&#9;NodeWatcher.register(this);&#10;&#9;&#9;listener.addNotifierOneShot(this, \\n_go, action);&#10;&#9;}&#10;&#10;&#9;onEnd { | listener, action |&#10;&#9;&#9;NodeWatcher.register(this);&#10;&#9;&#9;// this.isPlaying = true; // dangerous&#10;&#9;&#9;listener.addNotifierOneShot(this, \\n_end, action);&#10;&#9;}&#10;} Similar extensions can be built for whatever object needs to monitor the closing or end of an object such as closing of a Window or stopping of a Pattern.","categories":[{"name":"classes","slug":"classes","permalink":"http://iani.github.io/categories/classes/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Notification","slug":"Notification","permalink":"http://iani.github.io/tags/Notification/"}]},{"title":"Registry: Hierarchical Namespaces","slug":"Registry","date":"2017-06-05T15:41:22.000Z","updated":"2017-06-05T17:15:07.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/06/05/Registry/","link":"","permalink":"http://iani.github.io/2017/06/05/Registry/","excerpt":"This class helps to store objects and to retrieve them using a key.
